		<ol>
			<li>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>BXB is committed to safeguarding customer information. In order to better serve your needs now and in the future, we may ask you to provide us with certain information. We understand that you may be concerned about what we will do with such information – particularly any personal or financial information. We agree that you have a right to know how we will utilize the personal information you provide to us. Therefore, we have adopted this Privacy Policy to govern the use and handling of your personal information.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Applicability</h2>
				<p>This Privacy Policy governs our use of personal information about you.</p>
				<p>Types of Information</p>
				<p>We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Information we receive from you on the BXB loan application web site
					</li>
					<li>
						Information we receive from your employer via periodic payroll information; and
					</li>
					<li>
						Information we receive from your employer from eligibility file extracts
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Use of Information</h2>
				<p>We request certain information from your employer to continually qualify your eligibility for the BXB Employee loan program. Only active employees, who meet specific income and employment tenure thresholds, are eligible for BXB loan offerings and the data received from your employer’s payroll system is required to independently verify this eligibility. We do not receive or store such specific information from your employer, such as social security number or bank account information, which would potentially compromise your online security.</p>
				<p>This payroll information is received from your employer on an ongoing basis in order to accurately assess your eligibility for BXB loan offerings at any point in time. Information received directly from you is further used to authenticate your identity.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Former Customers</h2>
				<p>Even if you are no longer our customer, our Privacy Policy will continue to apply to you.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Confidentiality and Security</h2>
				<p>We will use our best efforts to ensure that no unauthorized parties have access to any of your information. We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those individuals and entities who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We will use our best efforts to train and oversee our employees and agents to ensure that your information will be handled responsibly. We currently maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with data privacy laws to guard your nonpublic personal information.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Information Obtained Through Our Internet Site</h2>
				<p>BXB is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you we receive on the Internet. In general, you can visit the BXB Internet site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our Internet servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed and similar information. BXB uses this information to measure the use of our site and to develop ideas to improve the content of our site.</p>
				<p>Should you choose to apply for a BXB loan, we will first assess your eligibility by authenticating your employment. You will be required to sign up in our website and after completing the application several pieces of personally identifiable information will be forwarded to us by your employer containing an automated list of information for us to look up and verify your employment status and income/tenure eligibility.</p>
				<p>Once you are fully qualified as eligible and your identification is confirmed, you will be offered one or more qualifying BXB Loan Offers. Upon selecting your desired loan product, BXB will store your personal information.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Safeguards and Measures</h2>
				<p>To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with the Data Privacy Law. These measure include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. Moreover, we take a defensive, in-depth approach to implementing rigorous physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to ensure your information is safe from unauthorized access or misuse.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Methods of protecting your personal information</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Encryption & Website Certificates</li>
					<li>Session time-outs</li>
					<li>Passwords</li>
					<li>Identity theft Protection</li>
				</ol>
